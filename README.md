# Mini-Pinterest

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

# About
It is a project that emulates core features of Pinterest, developed using modern web technologies. It leverages Svelte for building user interfaces, ShadCN and Tailwind CSS for styling, TypeScript for type safety, Firebase for backend services, and Uploadthing for handling file uploads.

Key Features:

Svelte Framework: Utilized for building reactive and efficient user interfaces.
ShadCN and Tailwind CSS: Employed for consistent and customizable styling.
TypeScript: Ensures type safety and enhances code maintainability.
Firebase Integration: Provides backend services such as authentication and database management.
Uploadthing: Manages file uploads seamlessly.
Development Instructions:

Installation: Clone the repository and install dependencies using npm install.
Development Server: Start the server with npm run dev. To open the app in a new browser tab automatically, use npm run dev -- --open.
Building for Production: Generate a production-ready build with npm run build. Preview the build using npm run preview.
For deployment, consider installing an appropriate adapter for your target environment.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
